    <h2>What is Signal K ?</h2>
    <h3>A Free and Open Source universal marine data exchange format</h3>
    <p>
      Signal K is a modern and open data format for marine use.
      Built on standard web technologies including JSON, WebSockets and HTTP, Signal K provides a method for sharing information independent of the underlying communications protocol (e.g. NMEA0183, NMEA2000, SeaTalk, I2C, 1-Wire, ZigBee, etc) in a way that is friendly to WiFi, cellphones, tablets, and the Internet.
      A format available to everyone, where anyone can contribute, Signal K is the first truly open data format for the marine industry and is set to revolutionize how we consume and interact with data on boats.
    </p>
	 <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>
      All Signal K source code is published under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"

      That means that it is open source, but friendly to companies that want to use it in closed source applications or

    <h2>Who is Signal K for ?</h2>
    <p>
      Signal K was developed by boaters for boaters, with the intention of using the latest mobile and web technologies
	  to give you access to the same experiences on your boat as you have on land. Many of the developments happening 
	  in home automation and the "Internet of Things", can be marinised for use on pleasure boats, bringing new functionality 
	  and solutions, that will enrich your boating activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signal K is more than just a data standard, it is also the mobile apps, server software, web apps and compatible hardware
	  that generates and handles this new open data format. On this website, we have information and links that will help boaters
	  learn more about the features and benefits of Signal K and how to setup their own Signal K system. In addition we have
	  information and links that will help developers and marine electronics manufacturers quickly understand the Signal K
	  technology and how they can support it in their products.
