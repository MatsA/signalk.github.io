## {{page.title}}
Currently most of the “cutting edge” development is being done on the Signal K Node Server. Node is a popular
development platform based on Google Chrome’s JavaScript runtime environment. It is supported on many different
hardware platforms including x64, arm, arm64, ppc64le, power7, power8, and s390x.

A fully working version of the latest Signal K Node Server is currently running on the Signal K demo web server and if
you click on the link below it will open in a new tab. You will be taken to the Server’s “Dashboard” where you can then
click on the Webapps menu to see some typical Signal K Apps.

This is the same Node Server that you could be running on a Raspberry Pi on your boat and it would be your boat’s real
data being displayed in your web browser, rather than our demo data.
